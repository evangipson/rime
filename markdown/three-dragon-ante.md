- In [session 4](/pages/session-4), [Pillby](/pages/pillby) created the rules for [Three-Dragon Ante](#three-dragon-ante) while waiting for [Finnegan](/pages/finnegan) and [Brynn](/pages/brynn) to inflitrate the castle

### Rules
- Three-Dragon Ante is played with 2-8 players.
- The objective of the game is for the Dragon Slayer to slay all Dragons. If the Dragon Slayer dies, the Dragons win, at which point, a battle between Dragons to the death occurs, so one Dragon emerges as the winner.

### Roles
- There must be at least one Dragon Slayer and one Dragon. There may only be one Dragon Slayer.

### Cards
- The cards of Three-Dragon Ante have values for attack, health, and luck. Non-character cards may also require treasure if a Dragon plays them.

#### Character Cards
- Each deck contains 6 Dragon Slayer character cards, and 12 Dragon cards. These cards will contain the attack, health, and luck for each player of the game.

#### Action Cards
- Each deck contains 24 action cards that are played by characters on their turn in exchange for attack, health, or luck from their character.

#### Temporal Cards
- Each deck contains 4 temporal cards that alter characters.

#### World Effect Cards
- Each deck contains 12 world effect cards which alter the rules of the game.

#### Treasure Cards
- Each deck contains 24 treasure cards which Dragons desire due to some of their actions requiring treasure, and Dragon Slayers have no use for.

#### Equipment Cards
- Each deck contains 12 equipment cards which Dragon Slayers desire due to the boosts in stats equipment provides, and Dragons have no use for. 

### How To Play
1. The character cards are shuffled in a pile, and each character draws sequentially. When a player draws a Dragon Slayer card and there is already a Dragon Slayer, that player discards the selected Dragon Slayer card and re-draws until they draw a Dragon card.
2. Each player draws 6 cards from the pile of all other cards.
3. A player will play up to one card from their hand.
4. The game goes until there is one player remaining.
