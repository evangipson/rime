In [session 11](/pages/session-11), [the party](/pages/party) found a note addressed to the charred remains of [Macreedus](/pages/macreedus).

The text is as follows:
<pre>
Macreadus,

I’ve had enough of this damned, relentless cold. I feel it creep into my bones, my head, my heart. I’m heading back to Ten-Towns for a decent meal and a warm bed. I fear this endless winter has numbed your mind, and any tinkerer worth their chains can see the Summer Star is a fool’s errand. Maybe without me here to incessantly complain to, you’ll finally snap out of your obsession.

If you truly insist on dedicating your remaining days to this doomed project, might I suggest that three is better than two. I considered telling you before, but you were particularly rude about the dinner I made last night.

May the light of the Morninglord protect you,
Copper
