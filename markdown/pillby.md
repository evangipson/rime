- a gnome who is a furious note-taker and loves items
- interested in magical items and tinkering
- never hits
- only rolls well if he is solo and doing unimportant things, otherwise will not roll above a 5
- nobody listens to his badass, totally fool-proof ladder plans
- in [session 5](/pages/session-5), had a great "home alone"-style plan to escape certain death and pulled it off without a hitch
- in [session 10](/pages/session-10), killed [Sephek Kaltro](/pages/sephek-kaltro) completely purposefully
- In [session 11](/pages/session-11), touched the [Summerstar](/pages/summerstar) and fucking died
- In [session 17](/pages/session-17), had a dream about [Oghma](/pages/oghma) telling him to assist [Brynn](/pages/brynn) in finding out [what is wrong with Ten Towns](/pages/ritualistic-sacrifices)
